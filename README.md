  ### Description:
  The project is an assignment of a coding bootcamp program, with the purpose for students learn how to write JavaScript code using Node.js. In this project I have created an app that asks the user questions in the terminal and based on the answers, the app generates a professional-looking README file for their GitHub project. The README includes sections like the project's title, description, installation steps, how to use it, testing information, a license badge, and contact details like the GitHub link and email address. This tool helps developers document their projects easily and helps others understand the information about the projects.
  
  ### Installation:
  I have imported a repository with pre-set gitignore files and json packages made available by the bootcamp. Installed npm in nodejs by typing "npm i" in the terminal. I created the files "index.js" and "generateMarkdown.js". Started to code in the "index.js" file. Imported 'inquirer' to interact with the user through the command line by prompting questions and receiving answers. Imported 'fs' to work with the file system, including reading and writing files. Defined a constant variable 'filename' that stores the name of the ReadMe file to be created. Imported the 'generateMarkdown' function from the described path. Imported the 'path' module. Defined an array 'questions' to collect user input using the inquirer module. The array contains a 'name' property used to identify this question's answer in the user's response object. It contains a 'type' property where 'list' means it will present the user with a set of choices. It also contains a 'choices' property that holds an array of options from which the user can choose. Then, I have created a function named 'writeToFile' that takes two parameters('fileName' and 'data') to write README file. Used the 'fs.writeFileSync()' method to synchronously write data to a file on the file system. The first argument is the file path where the data will be written, using 'path.join()' to ensure platform independence. Used 'process.cwd()' that returns the current working directory, and 'fileName' is the relative or absolute path to the file where data will be written. The second argument is the 'data' that will be written to the file. The function returns the result of 'fs.writeFileSync()'. Then I created the function init which is responsible for initializing the process of generating a README.md file. The 'inquirer.prompt()' method is used to prompt the user with the 'questions' array defined earlier. It returns a Promise that resolves to the user's responses. Once the user provides their responses to the prompted questions, the 'then' method of the Promise is executed. The user's responses are available in the 'response' object. The 'generateMarkdown()' function is called, passing the 'response' object as a parameter using the spread operator ('...'). This function takes take the user's responses and generate the content for the README.md file based on the predefined template. The result of 'generateMarkdown()' is then passed as the 'data' parameter to the 'writeToFile()' function. The 'writeToFile()' function will write the generated content to the specified 'README.md' file synchronously on the file system. It is called with two arguments: 'README.md' and 'generateMarkdown()'. 'README.md' indicates that the generated content will be written to a file named 'README.md'. The result of 'generateMarkdown()' is the content that will be written to the 'README.md' file. At the bottom I called the function init to initialize the application. Then, moving to the generateMarkdown.js file, I added code to do the following. Created a function named 'renderLicenseBadge' that takes two parameters ('license' and 'badge') and returns a license badge based on which license is passed in. The function checks if the 'license' parameter is not equal to "none". If a valid license is selected, the function returns a Markdown-formatted license badge string URL. The badge string includes an image link pointing to an SVG badge that represents the chosen license. The URL for the image is constructed using the 'license' and 'badge' parameters. If 'license' is equal to "none", indicating that no license was chosen, the function returns an empty string. Then I have created a function named 'generateMarkdown' that takes a 'data' object as a parameter to generate the contents of the README.md file based on user input or other data. The function returns a string containing the dynamically generated content for the README.md file. The content is based on the properties of the 'data' object passed as a parameter. The function calls 'renderLicenseBadge()' to generate a license badge based on the 'license' and 'badge' properties in 'data'. The generated badge is displayed right below the title. The README content includes sections with outputs retrieved from 'data' inputs. At the end, I added code to export the 'generateMarkdown' function from the current module, allowing other modules to import and use it using 'require' making it accessible for generating markdown content or other tasks in those modules.

  ### Usage:
  Open the terminal, git clone the SSH key for this repository and navigate to the repository. Type "npm i" and then "node index.js". Answer the 9 questions that will be displayed on the terminal by either typing the answer or selecting one alternative from a list. When all the questions are answered, type "code ." and the VS Code program will be opened. The new generated file can be accessed by opening the README file in VS CodeTo before uploading it to GitHub. Next, if ready to upload on Github, follow the steps described under the "Test Instructions" section.

  ### Test Instructions:
  To test the application, simply add, commit and git push the file to the main branch of your directory, and when you navigate to your Github directory the README section will display the newly generated professional readme file.

  ### Contributing
  I have received advice from the UC Berkeley Extension tutors Henry Weigand and Corrado Alfano on pseudocoding, and Sheetal Srikumar on debugging my code. I also reached out to the Mozilla Developer webpage (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and NPM Docs (https://docs.npmjs.com/) for documentation.
